Element Content
The content of an HTML element is the information between the opening and closing tags of an element. In the example, the element content is “Codecademy is awesome!”.


List Item Element
The <li> list item element create list items inside:

Ordered lists <ol>
Unordered lists <ul>


Video Element
The <video> element embeds a media player into an HTML document for video playback. The src attribute will contain the URL to the video. Adding the controls attribute will display video controls in the media player.
The <video> element can contain text content between its opening and closing tags which will be displayed if the browser does not support the video format or if the video fails to load.


Emphasis Element
The <em> emphasis element emphasizes text and browsers will usually italicize the emphasized text by default.


Ordered List Elements
HTML ordered list, <ol>, elements are used to create lists of items with a sequential order. Each list item in an ordered list appears numbered by default. For example:

Code every day.
Build a portfolio.
Never give up.


Div Element
The <div> element is used as a container that divides an HTML document into sections and is short for “division”. <div> elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc


Closing Tag
An HTML closing tag is used to denote the end of an HTML element. The syntax for a closing tag is a left angle bracket < followed by a forward slash / then the element name and a right angle bracket to close >
Attribute Name and Values
HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name="value" and can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.


Line Break Element
The <br> line break element will create a line break in text and is especially useful where a division of text is required, like in a postal address. The line break element requires only an opening tag and must not have a closing tag.


Image Element
HTML image <img> elements embed images in documents. The src attribute contains the image URL and is mandatory. <img> is an empty element meaning it should not have a closing tag.


Video Text Content
Developers can add text in a <video> tag to display when a browser is unable to load a video. We can accomplish this by adding the text in between the opening and closing video tag.


Headings
HTML can use six different levels of heading elements. The heading elements are ordered from the highest level <h1> to the lowest level <h6>.


Paragraph Element
Paragraph elements, <p>, contain and display blocks of text.


Unique ID Attributes
In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.
When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform specific instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should only contain letters (a-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.)


HTML Attributes
HTML attributes are values added to the opening tag of an element to configure the element or change the element’s default behavior. In the provided example, we are giving the <p> (paragraph) element a unique identifier using the id attribute and changing the color of the default text using the style attribute.


Unordered List Element
The <ul> unordered list element is used to create a list of items in no particular order. Each individual list item will have a bullet point by default. For example:

Oculus Quest
Fender Telecaster
Record Player


Attribute
An <img> element can have alternative text via the alt attribute. The alternative text will be displayed if an image fails to render due to an incorrect URL, if the image format is not supported by the browser, if the image is blocked from being displayed, or if the image has not been received from the URL


Body Element
The <body> element represents the content of an HTML document. Content inside <body> tags are rendered on the web browsers.


Span Element
The <span> element is an inline container for text and can be used to group text for styling purposes. However, as <span> is a generic container to separate pieces of text from a larger body of text, its use should be avoided if a more semantic element is available.


Strong Element
The <strong> element highlights important, serious, or urgent text and browsers will normally render this highlighted text in bold by default.


HTML Element
An HTML element is a piece of content in an HTML document and uses the following syntax: opening tag + content + closing tag. In the code provided:

<p> is the opening tag.
Hello World! is the content.
</p> is the closing tag.


HTML Tag
The syntax for a single HTML tag is an opening angle bracket < followed by the element name and a closing angle bracket >. Here is an example of an opening <div> tag.


Anchor Element
The <a> anchor element is used to create hyperlinks in an HTML document. The hyperlinks can point to other webpages, files on the same server, a location on the same page, or any other URL via the hyperlink reference attribute, href. The href determines the location the anchor element points to.


Head Element
The <head> element contains general information about an HTML page that isn’t displayed on the page itself. This information is called metadata and includes things like the title of the HTML document and links to stylesheets.


Attribute
The target attribute on an anchor (<a>) element specifies where a hyperlink should be opened. For example, a target value of "_blank" will tell the browser to open the hyperlink in a new tab in modern browsers, or in a new window in older browsers or if the browser has had settings changed to open hyperlinks in a new window.


Indenting Nested in HTML
HTML code should be formatted such that the indentation level of text increases once for each level of nesting.
It is a common convention to use two or four space per level of nesting.


Linking to Spot on the Same Page
The HTML anchor element, <a> can create hyperlinks to different parts of the same HTML document using the href attribute to point to the desired location with # followed by the id of the element to link to.


HTML Element
The <html> element, the root of an HTML document, should be added after the !DOCTYPE declaration. All content/structure for an HTML document should be contained between the opening and closing <html> tags.


Anchor Tag
The anchor(<a>) tag is used to define the beginning and end of a hyperlink. Within the anchor tag, you can hyperlink different kinds of content such as internal pages, external pages or content on the same page. Some examples of content that can be hyperlinked are images and text.


Comments
In HTML, comments can be added between an opening <!-- and closing -->. Content inside of comments will not be rendered by browsers, and are usually used to describe a part of code or provide other details.
Comments can span single or multiple lines.


Whitespace
Whitespace, such as line breaks, added to an HTML document between block-level elements will generally be ignored by the browser and are not added to increase spacing on the rendered HTML page. Rather, whitespace is added for organization and easier reading of the HTML document itself.


Title Element
The <title> element contains a text that defines the title of an HTML document. The title is displayed in the browser’s title bar or tab in which the HTML page is displayed. The <title> element can only be contained inside a document’s <head> element.


File Path
URL paths in HTML can be absolute paths, like a full URL, for example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn or a relative file path that links to a local file in the same folder or on the same server, for example: ./style.css. Relative file paths begin with ./ followed by a path to the local file. ./ tells the browser to look for the file path from the current folder.
